			PlanteraJokeTip2: From what I can tell, Plantera is winning - but who's keeping spore?
			PolterghastTip1: A dash of sorts helps a lot with the spinning ring attack, since it lets you quickly reach the opening!
			PolterghastTip2: If one of the Polterghast's legs turn red, quickly back away; it's going to swipe at you and release accelerating projectiles!
			PolterghastDesperationPhaseTip: Polterghast's spirits have been released! But they don't seem very happy with us...
			ProvidenceDawnWarningTip: Make sure it doesn't become dawn if you fight Providence again!
			ProvidenceDuskWarningTip: Make sure it doesn't become dusk if you fight Providence again!
			PrimeTip1: His arms seem to be aiming towards where you’re heading, a direction change last second will surely throw off those calculations…
			PrimeTeslaTip: Those blue tesla mines are going to explode into gas; take cover!
			PrimeJokeTip1: Now this is a prime example of what NOT to do..
			ProfanedRoDTip: The profaned magic seems to be blocking your Rod of Discord!
			ProfanedDefenderTip: Ohhh, he's really mad now! Stay on your toes!
			ProfanedFlappyBirdTip: They've holed themselves up on the right, but if you get there you can probably breach their defenses!
			ProfanedFlappyJokeTip: That onslaught of fire walls reminds me of a certain game, but the players could only jump in the air! Good thing you have wings, right?
			ProfanedFlappyBirdEndTip: They're a really good team! You'll want to manage everything at once, taking it slow is your best shot!
			ProfanedHealerDeathTip: It's getting physical now! Don't let one distract you from the other!
			ProvidenceTip1: Her attack cycle is similar to the music cycle, try using the music as a way to guide you through the fight!
			ProvidenceTip2: Focus on dodging, You don't have to keep attacking at all times! What worth is there to damage if you dont live to see the end of it?
			ProvidenceExplosionTip: Those fireballs seem to only explode if they hit lava, you should probably bait them away!
			ProvidenceFinalPhaseTip: It looks like Providence is preparing something!
			QueenBeeTip1: Those Honey Shots sure are bouncy, don't move too fast else they will splatter everywhere!
			QueenBeeTip2: Getting rid of those extra hornets should be your top priority!
			QueenBeeTip3: Y'know, this poison is quite sickening; maybe you should search for a Bezoar?
			QueenBeeJokeTip1: I can't Bee-lieve that, totally uncalled for!
			QueenBeeJokeTip2: Oof, that mustve Stung...
			QueenSlimeTip1: If it feels like you can’t run, then don’t! Moving less will help a lot!
			QueenSlimeBladeBeamTip: What is THAT?! Get away from it! I don’t want to get atomized today!
			QueenSlimeCrystalTip: Those crystals are equally spaced... seems like you can dodge them the same way consistently!
			RavagerTip1: Some of Ravager's attacks reward you for staying close. Try not to run away!
			RavagerTip2: Manage the lingering blob splotches, last thing you want is to play "the floor is lava"!
			SignusTip1: Pay close attention when it’s about to do a blackout - it might give you more warning than you think!
			SignusShadowSlashTip: Watch out, he might try to trick you at the end!
			SignusBombTip: Those bombs will explode into kunai that fly towards you. Be careful!
			SkeletronTip1: Contrary to what you may think, running into the shadowflame walls will not work, take it slow!
			SkeletronTip2: Don't panic when Skeletron does his barrages of hand fireballs! Just jump and stay calm!
			SkeletronTip3: The homing skulls take a long while to turn around, so it's possibly better to stay in a general spot rather than run far!
			SkeletronJokeTip1: Geeettttttt DUNKED ON!!!
			SlimeGodTip1: They dont seem very intelligent, maybe you could trick them to jump higher if you do aswell?
			SlimeGodTip2: That was a little overwhelming! I wonder if mirroring its moves could work in your favor?
			StormWeaverTip1: Those cloud barrages can take you by surprise! Stay focused - that storm scourge only seems to be focused on summoning attacks, not ramming you!
			SCalJokeTip1: Do you want my Witch's hat? Matching her atire could be fun...
			SCalTip1: Get close when she pulls out her crossbow, and you can see where she’s going to aim it!
			SCalSkullTip: So many skulls, but it appears they aren't focused directly at you! Try going inbetween!
			SCalDesperationTip: Even when all hell breaks loose, stay focused on your dodging!
			SCalFireSpinTip: Dont feel overwhelmed by all the projectiles, keep your cool during this flaming match!
			SCalFireChargeTip: Those bombs take up a lot of space! Try leading her to shoot them where you can easily get away!
			TwinsTip1: Having trouble dodging during the spin? Three can play at that game, Spin along!
			TwinsFinalOptionTip: Each one of the Twins has their own special last resort procedure, if one is giving you a hard time; try focusing on the other first!
			TwinsFinalPhaseTip: Watch out, that last twin is gonna hit you with everything it's got! Don't let up!
			WoFTip1: Be sure to run the opposite direction!
			WoFTip2: These detached eyes are rather intimidating, Good thing they only shoot at very specific points!
			WoFTip3: Yuck, Those grotesque mouths break off and fly?! Wish I could just burn them in an Inferno myself…
			WoFJokeTip1: Welp, that one was a bust! Nothing beats having more opportunities to bully the Guide though!
			YharonPreHealTip: You're almost there! Yharon is surely at the end of his rope now!
			YharonPostHealTip: Oh..
			YharonSpeedTip: Try and remember when Yharon starts hyper-dashing, or he’ll catch you off guard!
			YharonFlashbangTip: Don't let the flashbang faze you! Keep your eyes peeled for where the embers are!
			YharonCarpetBombTip: Better stay near the edges of the arena during those carpet bomb flames, That should keep them out of the way!
			YharonJokeTip1: AND IF I SHOULD DIE BEFORE YOU CONTINUEE, YOU SHALL HAV-... Wait, you died? Come on, I was on a roll here!
