# Infernum Mode

An extension mod for Calamity that adds an extra difficulty - Infernum

This difficulty is harder than Death mode and can be activated with the difficulty selection UI in Calamity.
The primary focus of the mod is expansive reworking of boss AIs.

Some bosses gain extra phases for maximum "It's not over yet!" energy.
